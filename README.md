[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/redlicadev/scrapedown)

This project is a Cloudflare worker designed to scrape web pages and extract useful information, including a markdown-formatted version of the content. It's built to handle requests to scrape a given URL and return structured data about the page.

## Features

- Fetch and scrape content from any given URL.
- Extract metadata such as title, byline, excerpt, and more.
- Convert HTML content to clean markdown format.
- Handle requests with optional markdown formatting.
- Remove everything but the content (Reader Mode)

## Usage

To use this worker, send a GET request to the worker's endpoint with the `url` query parameter specifying the page to be scraped. Optionally, you can include the `markdown` query parameter to specify whether the content should be returned in markdown format (default: `true`).
